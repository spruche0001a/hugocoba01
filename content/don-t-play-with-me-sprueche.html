        <p>In essence, it’s a warning. I wake up and say a prayer thanking god for today yeah yeah yeah and another chance for me to make a way look in the mirror and tell self get out the way lace up my boots. Don&#039;t play with me (don&#039;t play with me) go do what you need, that&#039;s okay with me. Don’t play with me because i play better than you. I am not a toy.</p>
